# 100 Days Of Code - Bondor's Log

### Day 0: August 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began my 100 Days of Code Challenge by dusting off my github account, forking this repo, and re-familiarizing myself with the flow of things.

**Thoughts:** Shaking off the rust is hard, but feels good.

**Link to work:** Under Construction! lol
