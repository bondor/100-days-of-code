# 100 Days Of Code - Bondor's Log

### Day 1: August 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began my 100 Days of Code Challenge by dusting off my github account, forking this repo, and re-familiarizing myself with the flow of things.

**Thoughts:** Shaking off the rust is hard, but feels good.

**Link to work:** Under Construction! lol


### Day 2: August 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent over an hour crunching exercises w/ the #GrasshopperApp, great way to refresh the fundamentals. Also getting familiar and imaginative with #D3 and SVGs. I like the prospect of imagines without image files. Also spent some time on The Odin Project and read several articles recommended there.

**Thoughts:** My mental bandwidth is limited.

**Link to work:** Still Under Construction! Still lol


### Day 3: August 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed video series on HTML Fundamentals, spent more time on javascript exericess, spent some time on D3 and web accessibility theory

**Thoughts:** This is hard, but rewarding :)

**Link to work:** I'll get to it, yeesh...
